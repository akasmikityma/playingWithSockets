all the user first fills a form {name,roomname} and joins the dashboard 

untill now {name,roomname} user created and a room and that user 

JOIN_room was making 2/more  users get into a single room 

message to message each other in the room 

//so when creating the user have a room created and just erase the toDashboard part from the index.ts 
  >> can i use transaction there ?
  like first create the user and then create a room 
//for JOIN_ROOM have that user in the room or create one 
//the messages are put . 

1. rooms are getting created and shown -

-- make sure that only the rooms that are the user is part of are shown there 
-- make sure clicking on those divs get the user to the actual chat comp and message the other user 

//the messages are indeed getting in the database ..but need to make sure that both the user gets to see those messages >>
